<h1>X-WINDOW EVENTS</h1>
<p>The X-Window system is bi-directionnal. On one hand, the program
sends orders to the screen to display pixels, images, and so on. On the
other hand, it can get information from the keyboard and mouse
associated to the screen. To do so, the program receives "events" from
the keyboard or the mouse.</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>To receive events, you must use <strong>mlx_loop</strong> (). This
function never returns. It is an infinite loop that waits for an event,
and then calls a user-defined function associated with this event. A
single parameter is needed, the connection identifier <em>mlx_ptr</em>
(see the <strong>mlx manual).</strong></p>
<p>You can assign different functions to the three following
events:<br />
- A key is pressed<br />
- The mouse button is pressed<br />
- A part of the window should be re-drawn (this is called an "expose"
event, and it is your program's job to handle it).<br />
</p>
<p>Each window can define a different function for the same event.</p>
<p>The three functions <strong>mlx_key_hook</strong> (),
<strong>mlx_mouse_hook</strong> () and <strong>mlx_expose_hook</strong>
() work exactly the same way. <em>funct_ptr</em> is a pointer to the
function you want to be called when an event occurs. This assignment is
specific to the window defined by the <em>win_ptr</em> identifier. The
<em>param</em> adress will be passed to the function everytime it is
called, and should be used to store the parameters it might need.</p>
<p>The syntax for the <strong>mlx_loop_hook</strong> () function is
identical to the previous ones, but the given function will be called
when no event occurs.</p>
<p>When it catches an event, the MiniLibX calls the corresponding
function with fixed parameters:</p>
<pre><code>
  expose_hook(void *param);
  key_hook(int keycode,void *param);
  mouse_hook(int button,int x,int y,void *param);
  loop_hook(void *param);
</code></pre>
<p>These function names are arbitrary. They here are used to distinguish
parameters according to the event. These functions are NOT part of the
MiniLibX.</p>
<p><em>param</em> is the address specified in the mlx_*_hook calls. This
address is never used nor modified by the MiniLibX. On key and mouse
events, additional information is passed: <em>keycode</em> tells you
which key is pressed (look for the X11 include file "keysymdef.h"), (
<em>x</em> , <em>y</em> ) are the coordinates of the mouse click in the
window, and <em>button</em> tells you which mouse button was
pressed.</p>
<h1>GOING FURTHER WITH EVENTS</h1>
<p>The MiniLibX provides a much generic access to all X-Window events.
The <em>mlx.h</em> include define <strong>mlx_hook()</strong> in the
same manner mlx_*_hook functions work. The event and mask values will be
taken from the X11 include file "X.h".</p>
<p>See source code of mlx_int_param_event.c to find out how the MiniLibX
will call your own function for a specific event.</p>
